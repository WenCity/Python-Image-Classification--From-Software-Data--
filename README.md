# Python-Image-Classification-TensorFlow
This program classifies images from "from Software games". It creates an image classifier using a tf.keras.Sequential model, and loads data using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory. 
The code is practical as it can be scaled up to larger data sets.

In this code we:
Efficiently load a dataset.
Apply techniques to mitigate overfitting, as well as using data augmentation and dropout.
